Add your general design and decision comments here:

I created a React project and seperated the components according to the sections on the screen.
each section has its store - The user details in the user-store file and the messages that has the messages-store.

I didnt have ping on Saturday, so I needed to create my own server with server.js file. To run it you should go to ->
chat-ui/src in the cmd and run - node server.js.

I had a problem with where to put the "const socket - io("localhost:8000");"
I think I need to put it only in one place, probably should have created a service file that imports it in one place.



Feedback regarding this exam is always welcomed.
What did you like? What didn't you like? What was missing?

It was the first time I created my own server - I needed to read a lot about socket.io.
I liked it after having a few problems with how to combine it with react and where should I put everything..
another problem I had is that I'm used to typescript and I needed to write the code with javascript..

I think the task is good, although I couldnt connect to the endpoint you gave me.
and screenshot folder is not attached..
